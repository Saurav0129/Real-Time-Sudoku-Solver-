# Real-Time-Sudoku-Solver-

This project is a Streamlit-based Sudoku Solver WebApp that allows users to upload an image of an unsolved Sudoku puzzle, solves it using a **Backtracking algorithm**, and provides the solved puzzle in both text and image formats for easy download.

## Features ✨

- **UI Streamlit WebApp**: A user-friendly interface that allows users to upload an image of a Sudoku puzzle.
- **Sudoku Solver**: Solves the Sudoku puzzle using a Backtracking algorithm
- **Image Output**: The solved puzzle is displayed as an image, and users can download the image.

## Technologies Used 💻

- Python 🐍
- Streamlit 🚀
- OpenCV 🖼️
- NumPy 🔢
- Tensorflow 🤖

## About the Sudoku Solver Algorithm 🧠

The Sudoku solving algorithm uses a **backtracking** approach, which is a form of depth-first search. It tries possible numbers in the empty cells of the Sudoku grid and checks if the number violates Sudoku rules (i.e., no number repeats in any row, column, or subgrid). If a violation occurs, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different number.

 ## Prerequisites ⚙️

Before running the app, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (for installing Python packages)

## Installation 🔧

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sudoku-solver-webapp.git
   cd sudoku-solver-webapp
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run 🏃‍♂️

To run the web app, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app will start running locally and you can access it via:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

## How It Works 🔍

1. **UI of Streamlit WebApp**: The Streamlit app provides a simple interface where users can upload an image of a Sudoku puzzle.
2. **Upload Image**: After uploading, the image is processed using **OpenCV** for preprocessing, contour detection, and perspective transformation to extract the Sudoku grid.
3. **Solve Puzzle**: The digits in the grid are recognized using a **TensorFlow model** that detects the numbers from the image.
4. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Once the digits are recognized, a **backtracking algorithm** is used to solve the Sudoku puzzle by filling in the missing numbers.
5. **Display Solved Puzzle**: The solved puzzle is displayed on the webpage for the user to view.
6. **Download Solved Puzzle**: Users can download the image of the solved Sudoku puzzle by clicking the "Download Solved Sudoku" button.
